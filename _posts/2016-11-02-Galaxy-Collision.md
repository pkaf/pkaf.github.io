Prof. Lewis and I wrote a brief post (https://theconversation.com/the-cosmic-crime-scene-hunt-for-clues-on-how-galaxies-are-formed-67438) on the Conversation lately, where we attempted to touch on a unsolved puzzle about how large galaxies, like our own Milky Way and the nearby Andromeda Galaxy, emerge from the featureless soup that existed after the birth of our universe.

The article was written as outreach piece to describe [recent scientific](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/833/2/167) finding by Lewis and his collaborator.
