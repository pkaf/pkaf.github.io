I recently wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@oldyak/the-3ps-of-sustainable-and-successful-data-science-career-fa666c97dda2) on the Medium talking about 3 critical Ps that could lead to a reward Data Science Career. 

TLDR summary of the article is that to build a career in data science that lasts, focus on:

  * Master your platform, but donâ€™t obsess over tools.
  * Embrace a clear, iterative process that fuels delivery and insight.
  * Invest in partnerships with stakeholders based on trust, empathy, and evidence.
