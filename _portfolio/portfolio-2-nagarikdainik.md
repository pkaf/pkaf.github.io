My discovery that the Milky Way’s mass is only half of what had long been believed — [see here](https://pkaf.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/) — was featured on the banner page of the local daily back home. My parents, who subscribed to the paper, were pleasantly surprised that morning when they went to the gate to collect it, flipped it open, and saw their son’s picture on the front page. It was a very happy moment for me, as I had made them proud.

I’m grateful to Mani Sir from Nagarik News for giving a scientific result such prominence in a space usually dominated by political stories.
I did certainly enjoy the lime light.
