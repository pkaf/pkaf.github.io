Here’s a [short interview](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/worldtoday/australian-scientist-reveals-milky-way-contains/5809556
) with me on ABC’s World Today, covering our discovery that the Milky Way contains only half as much dark matter as previously thought.

The picture shows how the different components of the Milky Way Galaxy—its disk, central bulge, and surrounding dark matter halo—jointly contribute to its overall mass and sustain an almost flat velocity curve as you move outward, allowing us to calculate the galaxy’s total mass.

A more sensationalised title — along with a Nepali-language version — was produced by the SBS Podcast [here](https://www.sbs.com.au/language/nepali/en/podcast-episode/not-a-bigger-neighbour-anymore-new-discovery-by-a-nepali-changes-galaxies-theory/s0ftedfw8).
