Welcome to my site. I’m a full-stack data scientist with a Doctorate in Astrophysics. Originally from the Himalayas, I now call Australia home.

I’m the product of a humble upbringing and a lifelong journey of learning, unlearning, and growth. 
My path has been shaped by the unwavering support of my family, the generosity of brilliant mentors who continue to inspire me and with sprinkle of hard work.


In my postdoctoral research, I developed a physically motivated, unsupervised clustering algorithm in Python, trained on data from the GAMA Galaxy Redshift Survey[3](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/479/3/3746/5039667). This [algorithm](https://github.com/pkaf/galtag) refined galaxy distance (redshift) measurements by associating them with their corresponding galaxy clusters.

Out of academia, I got to upskill in the world of commercial data science because of a company of brilliant mentors. My interests encompasses all three core topics of Data Science, namely, 
    
    Machine Learning Ops: CI/CD, End-to-end model delivery, monitoring 
    Experimentation Ops: A/B testing, Hetero Treatment Effect and
    Scientific Excellence Ops: Model Delivery Life Cycle, CRISP-DM
    
I code in python, love to contribute to open source DS initiative and company internal shared code base.

Welcome to my site. I’m a full-stack data scientist with a Doctorate in Astrophysics. Originally from the Himalayas, I now call Australia home.

During my PhD, I measured the mass of our home galaxy, the Milky Way, using kinematic tracers and open-source data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey — determining it to be billions of times the mass of the Sun[1](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/761/2/98)[2](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/794/1/59). In my postdoctoral research, I developed a physically motivated, unsupervised clustering [algorithm](https://github.com/pkaf/galtag) in Python, trained on data from the GAMA Galaxy Redshift Survey, to refine galaxy distance (redshift) measurements by associating them with their corresponding galaxy clusters[3](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/479/3/3746/5039667).

Stepping out of academia, I was fortunate to upskill in the world of commercial data science, guided by brilliant mentors. My interests now span all three core pillars of Data Science:

  - Machine Learning Ops: CI/CD, end-to-end model delivery, monitoring

  - Experimentation Ops: A/B testing, heterogeneous treatment effect analysis

  - Scientific Excellence Ops: Model delivery life cycle, CRISP-DM framework


I code primarily in Python and am passionate about contributing to open-source data science initiatives as well as enhancing internal shared codebases. My path has been shaped by hard work, the unwavering support of family, and the generosity of mentors who continue to inspire me.
