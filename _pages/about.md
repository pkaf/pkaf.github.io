Welcome to my site. 

I’m a full-stack data scientist with a Doctorate in Astrophysics. Originally from the Himalayas, I now call Australia home.

I’m the product of a humble upbringing and a lifelong journey of learning, unlearning, and growth. My path has been shaped by the unwavering support of my family, the generosity of brilliant mentors who continue to inspire me and with sprinkle of hard work.

Earlier in my academic career, I developed a physically motivated, unsupervised clustering algorithm in Python, trained on data from the GAMA Galaxy Redshift Survey [[1]](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/479/3/3746/5039667). This [algorithm](https://github.com/pkaf/galtag) refined galaxy distance (redshift) measurements by associating them with their corresponding galaxy clusters.

Similarly, during my doctorate I studied and used the kinematic properties of the Milky Way and estimated its total mass to be under a trillion solar masses!! The papers I co-authored with my mentors have since earned gratifying citations worldwide [[2]](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/761/2/98) and [[3]](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/794/1/59).

Out of academia, I got to upskill in the world of commercial data science because of a few mentors I met along the way. My interests encompasses all three core topics of Data Science, namely, 
    
    Machine Learning Ops: CI/CD, End-to-end model delivery, monitoring 
    Experimentation Ops: A/B testing, Hetero Treatment Effect and
    Scientific Excellence Ops: Model Delivery Life Cycle, CRISP-DM
    
I code in python, love to contribute to open source DS initiative and company internal shared code base.
