Welcome to my site. I'm a full-stack data scientist with a Doctorate in Astrophysics. Originally, from the Himalayas I have made Australian my home. 
I am a bi-product of a humble upbringing and a lifelong journey of learning, unlearning, and growth. 
My path has been guided by hard work, the unwavering support of family, and the generosity of brilliant mentors who continue to inspire me.
