With the intention of sharing knowledge more widely—and, importantly, keeping a record for myself—I’m starting to jot down thoughts here. 

My plan is to write at least three working days a week. 

Everything shared here should be considered personal reflections and hypothetical scenarios based on what I hear, learn, or recall from day-to-day life and past experiences. Any resemblance to real events is purely coincidental.
