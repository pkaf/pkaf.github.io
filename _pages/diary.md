With the intention of sharing knowledge more widely—and, importantly, keeping a record for myself—I’m starting to jot down thoughts here. 

My plan is to write at least three working days a week. 

Everything shared should be taken as personal reflections and hypothetical scenarios based on what I hear, learn, or recall from by day-to-day but also past experiences; any resemblance to real events is purely coincidental.
