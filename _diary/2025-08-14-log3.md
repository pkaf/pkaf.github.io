A Feature Store can be a Data Scientist’s most impactful — and most complex — product. In a mature company, it must power future models while retrofitting past ones, with automation, CI/CD, and clear ownership built in. Senior DSs should lead, not leave ML Engineers scavenging model by model. Get the prep right — from aggregation windows to DS-driven feature pushes — and let DSs do the first round of data exploration and feature engineering before bringing in ML Engineers. Skip that, and you risk watching DS work die a slow spiritual death.
